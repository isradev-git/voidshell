Since then, I've built my path around systems, servers, and web development, working with technologies like JavaScript, PHP, Python, and environments like Linux, WSL2, and server administration (Windows/Linux).<br/><br/>I started creating interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but my curiosity led me beyond the frontend. Today, I develop complete applications with a full-stack approach, integrating backend logic, automation, and good web security practices: vulnerability analysis, application hardening, and secure server maintenance.<br/><br/>I am also passionate about designing interfaces with a cyberpunk and futuristic aesthetic—impactful, functional visuals with personality—always prioritizing a clear and effective user experience (UX/UI).<br/><br/>I currently work at Entreredes Consultoría Tecnológica, where I develop web solutions, manage infrastructures, and improve the security and performance of applications.<br/><br/>Constantly exploring, learning, and building.<br/>If you're interested in full-stack development, web security, or the Linux world with a technological and aesthetic perspective...

It is not a black box: it is transparent and gives you control.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\\\"font-bold\\\">Native automation:</span> UNIX environments are designed to automate tasks. Bash, cron, scripts... everything flows naturally.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\\\"font-bold\\\">Lightweight and customization:</span> You can have a system tailored to your needs, without unnecessary processes consuming resources.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\\\"font-bold\\\">Learning about systems:</span> If you want to understand how operating systems work from the inside, Linux is the way.</li></ul><p>I'm not saying it's easy at first, but I am saying it's worth it.</p><p>📌 If you are in web development, backend or systems… Linux is not just another option.
