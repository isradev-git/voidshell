Since then, I've built my path around systems, servers, and web development, working with technologies like JavaScript, PHP, Python, and environments like Linux, WSL2, and server administration (Windows/Linux).<br/><br/>I started creating interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but my curiosity led me beyond the frontend. Today, I develop complete applications with a full-stack approach, integrating backend logic, automation, and good web security practices: vulnerability analysis, application hardening, and secure server maintenance.<br/><br/>I am also passionate about designing interfaces with a cyberpunk and futuristic aesthetic—impactful, functional visuals with personality—always prioritizing a clear and effective user experience (UX/UI).<br/><br/>I currently work at Entreredes Consultoría Tecnológica, where I develop web solutions, manage infrastructures, and improve the security and performance of applications.<br/><br/>Constantly exploring, learning, and building.<br/>If you're interested in full-stack development, web security, or the Linux world with a technological and aesthetic perspective...

    "blog_post_1_content": "<div class=\"flex flex-col gap-3\"><p>If you are a developer and have not yet tried Linux as your main system, let me tell you something: you are missing a large part of the real development ecosystem.</p><p>I have been using Linux as my main system for years, and it is no coincidence. Here are some reasons why I think it is worth making the leap:</p><ul class=\"list-none flex flex-col gap-2\"><li>🔹 <span class=\"font-bold\">More realistic development environment:</span> Many production environments (servers, containers, etc.) run on Linux. Working on the same system helps to avoid errors and unexpected differences.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\"font-bold\">Full control:</span> Linux allows you to understand what is happening in your system. It is not a black box: it is transparent and gives you control.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\"font-bold\">Native automation:</span> UNIX environments are designed to automate tasks. Bash, cron, scripts... everything flows naturally.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\"font-bold\">Lightweight and customization:</span> You can have a system tailored to your needs, without unnecessary processes consuming resources.</li><li>🔹 <span class=\"font-bold\">Learning about systems:</span> If you want to understand how operating systems work from the inside, Linux is the way.</li></ul><p>I'm not saying it's easy at first, but I am saying it's worth it.</p><p>📌 If you are in web development, backend or systems… Linux is not just another option. It is an advantage.</p></div>",

And when you lead a development team, that becomes clear quickly.</p><p>In my experience, I have seen that there are especially practical profiles. They do not need an encyclopedia, but to understand the why and how of each step. For them, theory without real application does not work.</p><p>That is why, when I train new team members, I am clear about this:</p><ul class=\"list-none flex flex-col gap-2\"><li>✅ <span class=\"font-bold\">Visualize the problem:</span> I always have a whiteboard nearby. It allows me to clearly outline flows, architectures or errors. The visual accelerates understanding.</li><li>✅ <span class=\"font-bold\">Solve with them:</span> No just watching. I give them real problems and guide them as they try, fail and find solutions. This is how knowledge is consolidated.</li><li>✅ <span class=\"font-bold\">Ask more than answer:</span> Many times, a good question generates more learning than a detailed explanation.</li><li>✅ <span class=\"font-bold\">Review together:</span> Real-time feedback, looking at code together, is a very powerful learning tool.</li></ul><p>Training is not just teaching: it is knowing how to adapt knowledge to each mind.</p><p>And in development, that makes the difference between someone who complies... and someone who really understands.</p></div>",
